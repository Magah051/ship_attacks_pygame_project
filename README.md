# Ship Attacks with Pygame

The Ship Attacks game, also known as "space shooter", is a subgenre of shooting games in which players control a spaceship and face hordes of enemies in a space or cosmic environment. This type of game is often associated with "shoot 'em ups" (shmups), which focus on intense action and fast-paced challenges.

## How it works

- Controls: The player controls a spaceship, usually with two-dimensional movement, being able to move up, down, left and right. The ship is also capable of firing shots at enemies.
- Enemies: Spaceship games feature several types of enemies, which can vary in terms of size, speed, movement patterns and attacks. They usually appear in groups, forming "waves" of opponents that the player must defeat.
- Scoring: Scoring is a fundamental element in this type of game. Players earn points by defeating enemies and collecting items, and the score is often used to determine a player's ranking and progression in the game.
- Gradual challenge: The game's difficulty typically increases as the player progresses. Enemies and bosses become faster and more complex, requiring the player to hone their skills and strategies to continue advancing.
- Attack patterns: Many enemies and bosses have predictable attack patterns, meaning their movements and shots follow specific sequences. Players need to learn these patterns to avoid attacks and respond effectively.
- Visual and sound style: Shooter games often have a vibrant visual style, with futuristic elements and impressive visual effects. The soundtrack is often energetic and rhythmic, contributing to the intensity of the gameplay.
